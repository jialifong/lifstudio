title: I Use AI the Way I Use Mirrors -  To Notice What I wasn’t Seeing
date: '2024-03-26'
excerpt: >-
  When you work solo, clarity doesn’t come from brainstorms or boardrooms—it has
  to come from within. But sometimes, even your own thoughts feel too close to
  untangle. That’s where tools like AI come in—not to replace thinking, but to
  reflect it. In this piece, we explore how AI became less of a novelty and more
  of a quiet companion: helping shape messy ideas, stress-test strategy, and
  bring clarity to the work when the room goes silent.

In big teams, you have rooms.
Rooms full of ideas. Stakeholders. Healthy friction. Sometimes too much.
But still—someone to push back. To sharpen the message. To say, *“wait, is that really the point?”*

When you go solo—whether as a founder, strategist, or creative—the rooms get quieter.
And that silence, while freeing, can also feel disorienting.

There’s no whiteboard debate. No casual sparring.
Just you, your thoughts, and a blinking cursor.

That’s when tools like AI become surprisingly helpful.
Not to do the work for you—but to help you hear yourself again.

#### **How AI Became My Work Comrade**

I didn’t turn to AI out of novelty.
I turned to it out of necessity.

When you’re used to working in teams, you underestimate how often clarity comes from interaction—not inspiration.
A good question. A raised eyebrow. A colleague who makes you rethink a slide.

Alone, those cues disappear.
But the need for clarity doesn’t.

I began using AI the way I’d once used a teammate or a post-it wall:
To shape half-thoughts into something tangible.
To hold space for questions before I had answers.
To be a calm, unbiased mirror when my own thinking felt too close to call.

A space to say the messy thing—and have it handed back in a new shape.
Not perfectly, but productively.
Not to be more clever.
But to see what I was really circling around.

#### **Where It Helps Me Most**

1\. Framing a messy thought

I might ask:

> *“Can you rewrite this idea in three styles: reflective, strategic, and mentoring?”*

Not to choose the perfect one. But to see what’s beneath the tone.

#### 2. Sparring without ego

Sometimes I’ll prompt:

> *“What’s missing from this positioning statement?”*

Or:

> *“What would a sceptical founder push back on?”*

It helps me stress-test ideas—without the pressure of performance.

##### 3. Drafting the structure before the voice

I’ll request:

> *“Outline a blog post about the cost of misalignment in early startups.”*

Then I go in and write the real parts myself.

#### **What I Don’t Use It For**

This matters.
I don’t use AI to sound smarter.
I don’t use it to write things I don’t mean.
And I definitely don’t use it to bypass the thinking.

The value isn’t in what it says.
It’s in what it reflects back.

Because strategy isn’t about having more ideas.
It’s about making fewer, clearer ones—and knowing why they matter.

#### **A Quiet Companion for Clearer Thinking**

In a world where founders, creatives, and solo strategists are expected to move fast, sound polished, and think in public—tools like AI offer something quietly powerful:

*   A space to think without pressure

*   A rhythm for reflection

*   A partner that doesn’t interrupt

AI won’t replace your strategy.
But it might help you remember what you meant to say—before the noise got too loud.

#### **Closing Thought**

Just like a mirror, AI doesn’t change your face.
It just shows you what’s already there—but couldn’t be seen clearly.

For solo builders and thinkers, that reflection can be enough to move an ide
